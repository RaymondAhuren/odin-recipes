    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, <br> garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over <br> medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer <br> until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. <br> Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp <br> is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both <br> sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</p>
